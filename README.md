This is the final Project for  the Supervised Learning Course
# Survival-of-a-Patient

 ## Business Problem  
 A hospital has been attempting to enhance patient care conditions by analyzing historical patient survival data. Despite their efforts to scrutinize the data, they have been unable to pinpoint the primary factors contributing to higher survival rates.


## The dataset

The dataset contains the patient records collected from a hospital. 

The "Survived_1_year" column is a target variable which has binary entries (0 or 1).

•	Survived_1_year == 0, implies that the patient did not survive after 1 year of treatment

•	Survived_1_year == 1, implies that the patient survived after 1 year of treatment

•	D_Patient_Care_Situation: Care situation of a patient during treatment

•	Diagnosed_Condition: The diagnosed condition of the patient

•	ID_Patient: Patient identifier number

•	Treatment_with_drugs: Class of drugs used during treatment

•	Survived_1_year: If the patient survived after one year (0 means did not survive; 1 means survived)

•	Patient_Age: Age of the patient

•	Patient_Body_Mass_Index: A calculated value based on the patient’s weight, height, etc.

•	Patient_Smoker: If the patient was a smoker or not

•	Patient_Rural_Urban: If the patient stayed in Rural or Urban part of the country

•	Previous_Condition: Condition of the patient before the start of the treatment ( This variable is splitted into 8 columns - A, B, C, D, E, F, Z and Number_of_prev_cond. A, B, C, D, E, F and Z are the previous conditions of the patient.

Objective:
To develop a predictive model for assessing the likelihood of a patient’s survival after one year of treatment.
